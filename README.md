Lecture Notes by Prof. M. Mert Ankarali

In this repository, you can find lectures I have created for courses I teach at Middle East Technical University. There ars still lots of typos and bugs in these notes. Please commit a correction and let me know, if you can find such problems.

I also created some video lectures for some of my classes. You may be a little bit frustrated with the quality of the videos. However, some students still find the videos helpful in understanding some content. You can access the videos from the following link.
